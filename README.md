# Introduction to Generative Adversarial Networks

## Summary

Generative models have become biggest milestone toward unsupervised learning capability. Started from images generation cases, generative models are now expanded many types of data such as text, videos and time series, opening new opportunities to enhance vision, speech, NLU, graph mining and reinforcement domains.  Recent advances in generative models dominated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that use gamification of deep neural networks, combined with progress in stochastic optimization methods, theoretical re-formulation of probability divergences including various regularization and normalization techniques. This course a deep dive introduction of GANs with a focus on learning end-to-end models for basic generative tasks. During the 4-week course, students will learn to implement, train and evaluate their own GANs and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in generative models. This introductory course will also discuss application areas that have benefitted from GANs, including computer vision, speech and NLU.

## Prerequisites
- **Proficiency in Python**. All class assignments will be in PyTorch.
- **College Calculus, Linear Algebra**. Participants should be comfortable taking derivatives and understanding matrix vector operations and notation.
- **Basic Probability and Statistics**. Participants should know basics of probabilities, gaussian distributions, mean, standard deviation, maximum likelihood etc.
- **Basic Deep Neural Network**. Participants should understand basic deep neural network architectures such as MLP (Multi-layer Perceptron), DNN (Deep Feed-forward NN), CNN (Convolutional NN) and RNN/LSTM (Recurrent NN/Long Short Term Memory). Also, participants have to understand formulation of cost/loss functions, taking derivatives and performing optimization with gradient descent using back-propagation algorithm.
